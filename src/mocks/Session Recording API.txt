Session Recording API

Every target will have its own Trails, Correct Response and Incorrect Responses

For example:
Target 1 is having  5 Trails, 
Then we will show 1 of 5 Trails

Q: When we call session Recording API
A: Case: Correct Response
    Trail info : 1 of 5 Trails
    Correct Response count(initial): 0
    When we click on Correct Response, We need to call session Recording API, based on success response, 
    then we need to make first(1) trail box as Green and increase the Correct Response count by 1 and Highlignt Correct Response box with green color border.
    If it is 2 of 5 Trails, then we need to make second(2) trail box as Green and so on.

    Once we make trail box as green and increase the correct response count, then we need to move on to next trail(2 of 5), 
    now do we need to make Correct Response box with initial count(0) for this trail(2), with no green color border. am I right ? please confirm.

    When we move to next trail?
    Once we moved, then what is correct response count?
    When we should make a call to Session Recording API ?
    For every trail we need make aa call Session Recording API ?

    Case: Incorrect Response
    Incorrect Response will have 5 radio buttons,when we choose radio button, except last radio button, all will fill up current trail box with Orange, last one will fill up current trail box with Amber(Red).
    Once user selects radio, can have option to change ? If yes, then we make a call to Session Recording API ?
